<h1>Save The Oceans</h1>

<p>Everyone loves going to the beach for vacations and would love to go to a paradise beach like the one above. But no one likes waters that are polluted with waste, so we need to keep the beaches clean and to do that, keep the oceans clean! The oceans are one of the most important assets to mankind. The oceans cover roughly 3/4 of the surface of Earth and humans are currently destroying this resource daily. This valuable natural resource is being corroded every day by pollution. Pollution by dumping waste in the oceans and air pollution are the main two affecting the quality of the oceans and destroying marine life. Humans are the cause of this destruction so surely we can help make it right again, but it will take a mass effort. If something doesn't change soon the Earth will go through major changes that will negatively affect people around the globe.</p>
<h3>Pollution Per Year</h3>

<p>As you can see there is a large amount of waste going into the oceans each year. This abundance of waste polluting the oceans are having a very negative effect on many organisms in the ocean. Most of the waste that enters the ocean comes from land, nearly 80 percent of pollution in the ocean is from land. The most disruptive material being polluted into the ocean is plastic. Plastic makes up nearly 40% of the total waste that enters the ocean and is not biodegradable. Many animals mistake this waste as floating jellyfish and consume the plastic. This causes problems for the animals that consume jellyfish because they are constantly consuming the plastic bags and dying from this mistake. Many are becoming endangered due to the fact of ingesting this but also because of entanglement and the destruction of habitat. These are all serious consequences from polluting that are causing marine life to become endangered and some will soon become extinct because of this.</p>

<h3>How to Save the Ocean</h3>
<p>This is a large task not to be for few people to take care of. This must consist of the effort from many people to help decrease pollution of the oceans. There are little things every day that people can do to help preserve the oceans. The first thing that people can easily do in every day life is to buy or use less bottled water because bottled water is a major contributor to the amount of plastic in the ocean. If everyone would use a reusable bottle for refill it, a large portion of the amount of plastic being dumped in the ocean would go down. Second is to recycle as much as possible because then it will be re-used and stay out of the environment longer. Third is to use more eco-friendly material rather than non-biodegradable. This is a little thing people can do every day by using a paper bag instead of plastic at the grocery store. Here is the shortened list of the things people can do.</p>

	<li>Buy less bottled water</li>
	<li>Recycle as much as possible</li>
	<li>Use eco-friendly, biodegradable products</li>
